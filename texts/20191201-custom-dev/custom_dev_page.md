- **What On-Demand means?**<br>
  From experience, a one-off work is rare. Usually, app development is a long process with short intense development phases and low activity maintainability periods. When you need to add a feature to your web app, you can count on me at any time of the year.
- **Why PHP?**<br>
  PHP proved to be the most popular language for web applications. It has dynamic types, which makes programming fast and flexible. Through decades a huge community gathered around it, great products and tools were developed. Nowadays, PHP is the de-facto standard for web development used by biggest
  projects including Wikipedia, Facebook and others.
