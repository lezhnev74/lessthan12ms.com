# Affordable Custom Development In PHP 

## Do you need our services? Let's check

1. You have an old PHP application that many developers worked on. This app works and brings money in but few can fix bugs or add new features because of the mess under the hood. 
2. You need to validate your idea. So you need to build an app and see if it makes you money, but you have no team to develop and support it.

If some of the above seem correct, then we will gladly work with you.

## About the team
We are a small and humble team located in Russia, [Yekaterinburg](https://www.google.com/search?q=yekaterinburg). 
We don't rent an office, instead, we work from home offices or co-working spaces. It makes no sense to spend time on
 commuting and renting a place because we are seasoned remote workers. That is why we can keep our prices low.

Let me introduce myself. I am Dmitry Lezhnev, the one who assembled this team. My role here is a project manager and
a lead developer who control the quality of the products we make here. My experience with web apps development
 started in 2010 when I started learning PHP language and the Web. I successfully passed [the Zend Exam](http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND031138) hold by a
  company that created PHP and leads its development nowadays. I write things about my work here in [the blog
  ](/). You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitriy-lezhnev/), on [Github](https://github.com/lezhnev74) or on [Twitter
  ](https://twitter.com/dimalezhnev). We work in a remote fashion for years and maintain high work ethics with our
   clients.
  
## What Custom Development Means?

Can you distill your business model? What is an essential process brings you money? We would cut all the bells and
 whistles and build an app that embodies that process 1-to-1, tailored specially for you. We call such an ap an MVP
  (minimal viable product). Then we would see how paying customers use it, and learn from them. Then you can clearly
   see if the product works or not without spending much time or budget. If all looks good we then would build new
    features that make sense to your paying customers. If app does not fly up, we can decide if it can do a pivot
    . Rinse and Repeat.   
     
Adaptation and learning mean changing MVP constantly. Adding new features and learn again. Custom web development is
 the best way to build an app your customers will love.

Now, there are off-the-shelf solutions like Shopify, Wordpress, Drupal, etc. If you feel that you can get what you
 need out of them, then it is the right thing to do for you. There are downsides as well, those tools are built for
  all and quite complex in customization. To adapt them to your needs an expert required who knows how to do that
  . The effort can be not worth it as each tool has its constraints.
  
Authors of such general-purpose tools do not know you, nor care about you. They do not understand, nor solve your
 problems. They solve their problems. When you use those tools you make an enormous commitment to them, hey, you bet
  your success on them. But they are only do this much, any special needs of your app are not satisfied. There is no
   commitment from their side to you. The choice is yours but we remain skeptical.

## Strategy For Your App
It makes sense to distill your most important business process and build it first with the least budget. Later get
 feedback from customers and build new features in small chunks where customers need them.
 
1. **Run MVP in ~30 days** (~$2500-$10000/month)
    - Distill your business process
    - Build the most critical processes in the app
    - Start selling
2. **Support it for 1-6 months** (~$1000-$5000/month)
    - Learn from paying customers
    - Add new features
    - Solve performance bottlenecks
    - Defend against attacks
    

## High Standards Of Software Development

1. **Test Driven Development**
Some developers get confused: *What part of the application do we need to test?*. The answer is certain: *Only those parts that you need to work*. 
Surgeons wash their hands before the surgery. We stay responsible for our work, we write tests for our code.  
2. **Clean Architecture**
We keep important business logic separated from low-level details like databases, delivery mechanisms, etc
. Proper boundaries keep a system secured, well balanced and easy to test.
3. **Accumulated Best Practices**
We build software designed specifically for the Web. Websites and Mobile apps communicate with the servers over the
 Internet. This is our home, our bread, and butter. We know what works and what doesn't, and we will gladly share it with you.
4. **Stable Pace**
Our experience gives us a good understanding of the speed of development. We keep the pace and deliver at predictalbe time.
 
## Payment policy
We favor post payment. We do our job first, we get paid after. However, we request a small ~10% advance payment from our new clients, just to filter out scammers.
