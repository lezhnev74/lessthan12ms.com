# Why I need a bigger monitor (monitors set) to improve quality of my code?
<p>I am a big fan of mobility, I love working from different places (a home office, coffee shops, planes and other places). That's why my main device is my laptop (13" display size). I kind of dislike the idea of being attached to a single workplace. But I have recently faced a little inconvenience working with explicitly named functions in my code.<!--more--></p>
<p>Look at my editor with some recent side project of mine:</p>
<p><a href="https://lessthan12ms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-24_z2y5z-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-354" src="https://lessthan12ms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-24_z2y5z-2-1024x624.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="624" /></a></p>
<p>Practicing proper naming which shows intents leads me to long names for functions and methods. And that gives me some unexpected outcomes - it is harder to work with them on a small screen of a laptop. </p>
<h2>Environment that enables quality</h2>
<p>I think a big monitor or a set of monitors will encourage me to use long explicit names in my code. As Jacque Fresco <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIz86hSrefI">stated</a>: "Environment shapes behavior". The big monitor will encourage me to keep long names which show my intentions in the code. </p>
<p>I hope to have one of those dual-monitor sets this year and feel the difference. At the end of the day, the work must be as joyful as possible and why limit me with laptop's screen size?</p>

<p>P.s. I like to listen to that old man. You might like it as well:</p>

### Update in march 2017
Well, I finally got my double-monitor setup and now enjoying 2x productivity. I chose Dell P2415Q monitor and it works just great with Macbook Pro, giving out 4K@60Hz.
