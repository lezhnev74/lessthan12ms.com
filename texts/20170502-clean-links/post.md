# Clean architecture links
In this post I will maintain the list of blog posts. projects and related things which cover the whole Clean Architecture subject (aka onion architecture, hexagonal architecture or "ports and adapters". This list is language/framework agnostic. 

**update 2018**: As of recently, I consider Event Sourcing as a way towards clean architecture, thats why I am including extra links about it.

## Implemented projects
* [Clean Architecture Example (Java): Example of what clean architecture would look like (in Java)](https://github.com/mattia-battiston/clean-architecture-example) + [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/mattiabattiston/real-life-clean-architecture-61242830)
* [Wikimedia Deutschland fundraising software (PHP)](https://www.entropywins.wtf/blog/2016/11/24/implementing-the-clean-architecture/)
* [Ema (php)](https://lessthan12ms.com/clean-architecture-implemented-as-a-php-app/)
